}
\arguments{
\item{csv_filepath}{A character path to the csv file.}

\item{lots_path}{A character path to the folder that stores the lot-specific
file (\code{.eds}) for the kit that was used to run the single antigen bead assay.
If the folder contains multiple lot files, the right one is read in

}
\value{
A data frame with (a selection of) the contents from the \code{.csv} and
\code{.eds} file. Its contents match the table that would be produced by loading
